<!-- here's my actual app. as things get bigger and export/import becomes available,
	we may rethink inserting a script tag for every file needed. this works for now. -->

<!-- update from above - 4/9/18 - I think I need to keep the views and controllers
	together, at least for now. I don't yet see a purpose for having them separate,
	especially for the root components and pages. Perhaps as I build items that are
	going to be nested inside them, we will have those views and controllers in separate
	files for readability and modularity. -->

<!-- I'm going to load the templates first so they are ready to be called. -->
<!-- navbar templates -->
<script src="app/root-components/navbar/templates.js"></script>
<!-- page-1 templates -->
<script src="app/page1-home/templates.js"></script>
<!-- footer templates -->
<script src="app/root-components/footer/templates.js"></script>

	
<!-- After utilities is loaded, the default view for Home is invoked. -->
<script src="app/root-views.js"></script>
<!-- Then the controller is invoked by request from the API. -->
<script src="app/root-controllers.js"></script>
<!-- The controller requests the templates/content from templates.
	Then calls render in the API. Render inserts the content. -->


<!-- My library, a work in progress. These objects are hidden to the global object.
	Note that this is separate from my SPA functionality. -->
<script src="src/Glass-1.js"></script>
<!-- Used for general js. Currently adds functionality for the sticky navbar.
	NOT the root of SPA/framework either. -->
<script src="app.js"></script>


<!-- My SPA backbone. Could be considered the API? Unlike Glass, my utilities
	are located on the global object. The onload events here are set to render
	the components I want to be loaded by default on page load. I think it may be
	better to have these here, to ensure whenever someone navigates around the site,
	we aren't reloading anything that isn't requested. Since the html is dynamically
	requested, these page load events should only fire once, since we are not
	requesting this html page more than once. -->

<!-- Maybe another reason for this process of dynamically rendering into a shell,
	is that I can control in what sequence things are loaded, visualized by how my
	router is invoked below. I just encountered an error inserting my footer, but
	everything else loaded just fine. Similarily, if I have a lot of data in the picture
	I'm loading in my hero, somebody with a slow connection can go ahead and start reading
	the page content since it is the first thing to be loaded below. This is due to
	Javascript being a synchronous language, that is only handling one request at a time. -->
